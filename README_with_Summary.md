# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

SUMMARY 

I am very excited to share my journey, as i received the email, I was excited that i got selected for the machine round and as soon as i got to know that i have to make a app  for machine code test, I started building the project very next day. 
I am good at React.js so i started developing from the frontend part, It was easy for me to design and maintain the code for that part but the tough part was the backend, as my hands fall short working in backend but i did know about the API call techniques and methods so I worked to get it done connecting the frontend and backend, I tried to keep the design simple but user attractive making the best news app and i think i have made a good progress learning and making this app.
On the second day i was ready with the fully functional, dynamic and responsive web app of ACONEWS, Now the main part came of deployment, for me it was the very first time deploying an app, i got stuck a lot times deploying the app, Take help of friends, gpt and various resources but finally achieved to deploy the app perfectly also.
Then after completing the whole app and process i learnt so many things new maintaining codes and apps, deployment, API calls and requests and response to API and various other technical and non-technical skills.

My process for working on this app remained somewhat like this:
Firstly i breakdown the whole process by summarizing the requirements and analyzing the need of technology.
As per the description provided by the company, It started by understanding the API from the gnews.io, making it more easy to start working on how to make API call and fetch the data.
Then i started to make the frontend project using React.js dividing the whole app in two pages for better design, Home and News. I used TailwindCSS for styling.
React.js was helpful as making components and it provides Routing to get easy API call in the same technology.
I used axios to fetch data from API and made the backend part in services directory of  src, making the backend and frontend combined and simple and convenient to find the backend files and connecting to frontend. 
I further breakdown components of both pages as Navigation bar, News Feed , Search Bar and Pagination which provides various functionality of navigation, news page, searching across so many news and pages to go to next pages for further more news respectively.
And the final part lies in Deploying and  uploading on firebase and github respectively.

This way i managed and completed my project within two days with fully functional, dynamic and responsive app i.e. "ACONEWS", the latest scoop machine, feeding users hot-off-the-press news from all over.
